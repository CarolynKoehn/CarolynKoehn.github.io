**Abstract**

As the climate changes, mismatches in phenology between predator and prey species
may become more common. For example, many songbirds rely on short peaks in
insect and fruit production at stopover sites during migration. Previous research indicates that migratory songbirds are able to modify their departure and arrival dates to
some extent despite their reliance on more stable cues such as photoperiod and more
stable endogenous factors. However, insect and plant phenology may shift more rapidly with changing climate, reducing foraging opportunities along migratory routes.
To quantify changes in songbird arrival patterns at stopover sites during fall migration
we analyzed forty years of banding data in nine passerine species commonly captured
at banding stations in southwestern Michigan. Weather data revealed that the region
has warmed by nearly 2Â°C over this timeframe. For each species, we assessed annual
trends in arrival date and temperature at arrival. To determine whether arrival trends
impacted stopover site function we also quantified trends in site use and morning mass
gain. Arrival dates advanced significantly in three species, and were delayed significantly in three other species. However, air temperature at arrival increased significantly
over time for all nine study species. Over the same time period, site use and the pattern
of morning mass gain remained stable or increased for all species. Despite the changing
climate and the resulting increase in temperature at arrival for migrants, our data indi-
cate that these stopover locations continue to function as a refueling sites. Nonetheless,
we must be wary of thresholds and ecological mismatches that may occur if warming
trends continue.
