I created a series of 8 video tutorials for R novices who need to analyze and visualize data for classes or research. Links to the videos, code, follow-up activities, and references are currently hosted on this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hOIgBJ1aVKGzzrn89KXlWlH2zs9XjZbgo3nw8EYj6DI/edit?usp=sharing). A university webpage to host these resources is under construction.
